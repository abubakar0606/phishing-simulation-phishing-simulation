# Phishing Awareness Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting a phishing simulation for security awareness
and training purposes. The goal of this task is to demonstrate how phishing
attacks are created and how users can be trained to recognize and avoid them.

The simulation was performed using **GoPhish**, an open-source phishing framework,
in a controlled and ethical environment.

This work was completed as part of the **Cybersecurity Internship at Internee.pk**.


## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this task are:
- To simulate phishing emails for awareness and training purposes  
- To understand how attackers design fake login pages and emails  
- To analyze user interactions with phishing campaigns  
- To improve awareness of phishing indicators  
- To generate a security awareness report  



## 🐟 Phishing Simulation Design

### 1️⃣ Email Template
A phishing-style email with a “Reset Password” theme was created using GoPhish.
The email was designed to appear urgent and convincing, similar to real-world
phishing emails.



### 2️⃣ Landing Page
A fake login page styled as an Instagram login screen was developed using
HTML and CSS. The page collected user input and then redirected users to
the real Instagram website to demonstrate how phishing pages operate.


### 3️⃣ Campaign Launch
The phishing campaign was launched using a local IP address as the phishing URL.
Test emails were sent in a controlled environment, and GoPhish was used to track:
- Email opens  
- Link clicks  
- Form submissions  



## 📊 Results & Analysis
The campaign results were analyzed to observe user behavior when exposed to
phishing emails. Metrics such as click rate and submission rate helped evaluate
how effective the phishing email was and highlighted the importance of awareness
training.



## 🛡 Awareness & Training
After the simulation, users were educated about common phishing indicators such as:
- Suspicious or shortened URLs  
- Urgent or threatening messages  
- Brand impersonation  
- Unexpected password reset requests  

This training aimed to help users identify phishing attempts and respond
appropriately.



## ⚠ Ethical & Legal Considerations
- This simulation was conducted strictly for educational and training purposes  
- No real credentials were collected or stored  
- No real users were targeted without permission  
- The environment was isolated and controlled  



## 🧰 Tools Used
- GoPhish (Phishing simulation framework)  
- HTML & CSS (Landing page design)  
- Web Browser (Testing)  
- GitHub (Documentation)

## 📌 Conclusion
This task demonstrates how phishing simulations can be used as a training tool
to improve user awareness and reduce the risk of real-world phishing attacks.
By simulating realistic phishing scenarios, this project highlights the
importance of education and regular testing in strengthening organizational
security posture.
