Phishing Simulation Notes

Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted
organizations to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as
usernames and passwords.

GoPhish is an open-source tool used to simulate phishing attacks for security
awareness and training purposes. It allows the creation of email templates,
fake landing pages, and campaigns to track user behavior.

In this task, a phishing email with a “Reset Password” theme was created.
A fake login page was designed using HTML and CSS and used as a landing page.
The phishing URL was hosted on a local IP address.

User interactions such as email opens, link clicks, and form submissions
were tracked using GoPhish. After the simulation, awareness training was
provided to explain common phishing indicators like suspicious URLs,
urgent messages, and brand impersonation.

The purpose of this simulation was educational and ethical. No real
credentials were collected or misused.
